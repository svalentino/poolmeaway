        <p>
            Extensions are not currently allowed to operate on <b>"chrome://"</b>
            URLs.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that this extension can not close/flush the socket
            pools automatically for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            You have two options:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b># Option 1</b><br>
            Allow extensions to operate on <b>"chrome://"</b> URLs.<br><br>
            Manually navigate to "chrome://flags/#extensions-on-chrome-urls" and set the value to <b>Enabled</b>. Once this is done, restart your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b># Option 2</b><br>
            Use this extention to just quickly reach the URL
            <b>"chrome://net-internals/#sockets"</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this scenario, you will have to manually click the
            two buttons on your own.
